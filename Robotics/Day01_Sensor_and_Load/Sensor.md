# Sensors
A device that gives output by detecing changes in its environment. 
There are different types of sensor such as light sensor, temperature sensor etc.

## Light Sensor
Light sensor is a device that measures the intensity of light by converting photons 
into electrical signals. It can detect various properties of light, such as 
intensity, wavelength, frequency, or direction, depending on the application.

## Obstacle Sensor 
An obstacle sensor is a device that detects the presence of 
objects or barriers in its path without physical contact. 

## Fire Sensor 
Fire sensor a type of sensor that can detect and respond 
to the presence of a flame or fire.  These detectors have the ability 
to identify smokeless liquid and smoke that can create open fire. 

## Motion Sensor
A motion sensor, is an electronic device that uses 
a sensor to detect nearby people or objects. 
Motion sensors are an important component of any security system. 

## Temperature Sensor
A temperature sensor measures heat and cold of an object or space. 
It can be used in various applications such as microwave ovens, 
fridges, air conditioners, and water temperature monitoring.
